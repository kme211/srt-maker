# srt-maker (WIP)

A desktop application for creating [srt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#SubRip_text_file_format) files.

## Why does this exist? 

This program exists to make timing subtitles to audio easier. It's not currently equipped to help with transcribing audio but that's a future possibility. 

## Technologies

I used an [Electron/React/Redux](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) boilerplate.

## Installation (development)

```
git clone https://github.com/kme211/srt-maker.git
npm install
```

## Run (development)
```
npm run dev
```

## Package 

See [boilerplate readme](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate#packaging) for packaging instructions.
